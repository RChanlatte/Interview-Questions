This is a simple repository containing a bunch of common interview questions. The objective of this repository is to serve as a proof of concept for me (testing my knowledge, really) and to act as fun little self-contained programming challenges to give me something to do.

All of the implementations will be done in approximately an hour or so (and be entirely my own), maybe extending to two hours if I am having trouble. I will not look anything up as I presume, in a professional setting, this won't be possible during an interview. After the two hour maximum time limit, I will then relax my requirements and begin searching around for the answer. If this is done I won't commit that question and, rather, hope to learn something from my searching so when I return to the problem at a later date, I can, hopefully, program without reference. That way, I can demonstrate my true understanding of the concepts involved.

All code availible here will be sourced under the MIT License. I don't care if anyone uses my code in practice or simply as a learning tool, if they believe it to be up to snuff.

Thanks for reading and enjoy.
